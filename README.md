My Scala Math Library

## Purpose

This repository tries to collect some useful math libraries like Python.

For the areas like satistics, Python has many OOTP libraries already.

However, not for Scala.

## Factorial

```python
math.factorial(x)
```

## Fibonacci

```bash
pip install py-fibonacci

def fibonacci(end=None, start=0, inclusive=True, length=None):
    ...

fibonacci(39) 
    -> only end number is given. there are several fibonacci numbers upto 39 starting at 0.

fibonacci(39, 3) 
    -> end and start numbers are given. there are several fibonacci numbers upto 39 starting at 3.

fibonacci(39, 3, False) 
    -> end, start numbers and inclusive=False are given. there are several fibonacci numbers upto 39 (exclusive) starting at 3.
```

## erf

```python
math.erf(...)
```
